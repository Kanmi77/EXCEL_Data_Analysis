# Breast Cancer Dataset Dashboard (Excel Project)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard analyzing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. It demonstrates how Excel can be used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, PivotTable analysis, and building dynamic visual reports.

## 📝 Key Highlights:
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:
  - Removed unnecessary columns.
  - Created a derived "Risk Level" based on `radius_mean`.
- Pivot Table Insights:
  - Diagnosis Distribution (Malignant vs Benign)
  - Risk Level Distribution (High, Medium, Low)
  - Feature averages by Diagnosis group.
- Visualizations:
  - Bar Chart (Diagnosis Distribution)
  - Pie Chart (Risk Level)
  - Scatter Plot (Radius vs Area Mean)
  - Heatmap using Conditional Formatting.
- KPI Cards displaying Total Patients, % Malignant Cases, and Average Radius Mean.

## 📂 Files Included:
- **Breast_Cancer_Dashboard.xlsx** — Excel file with PivotTables, Charts, and Dashboard layout.
- **Breast_Cancer_Dashboard.pdf** — Static PDF export of the Dashboard.

## 📚 Dataset Source:
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository — Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, Conditional Formatting, Charts, Dashboard Design)

## 🧠 Insights Summary:
- X% of the dataset cases are diagnosed as Malignant.
- A strong correlation exists between Radius Mean and Area Mean.
- Risk categorization based on Radius Mean aligns with Diagnosis outcomes.

## 🎯 Objective:
This project showcases how even simple tools like Excel can be leveraged for meaningful data analysis and visual storytelling, making it accessible for early-stage data analysts and bioinformatics enthusiasts.
